# SpecValidator CLI Specification

## Overview

The **SpecValidator CLI** is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to assist developers, product managers, and designers in creating and maintaining high-quality SpecLang documents. Its primary function is to analyze SpecLang documents, providing feedback on their structure, clarity, completeness, and adherence to SpecLang best practices.

## Core Goals

* **Improve Spec Quality:** Ensure specifications are well-structured, unambiguous, and comprehensive.
* **Enforce Consistency:** Help maintain a consistent style and level of detail across multiple SpecLang documents within a project or organization.
* **Early Error Detection:** Identify potential problems or omissions in the spec early, reducing costly revisions later.
* **Educational Tool:** Guide users in learning and applying SpecLang principles effectively.
* **Facilitate Collaboration:** Provide a common standard for teams working with SpecLang.

## Features

### Structural Linting

* Verify adherence to recommended SpecLang heading structures (e.g., Overview, Current Behavior, Proposed Solution, Clarifying Questions).
* Check for the presence of key sections appropriate for the document type.

### Clarity Analysis

* Utilize NLP techniques to flag potentially vague or ambiguous phrases.
* Named entity recognition (NER) to identify and categorize key entities within the text.
* Sentiment analysis to detect subjective language and ensure a neutral tone.
* Text coherence and cohesion analysis to ensure logical structure and clear information flow.

### Completeness Checks

* Ensure all required sections are present and complete.

## Usage

To use the SpecValidator CLI, run the following command:

```bash
node cli/specValidator.js <path-to-specLang-document>
```

Replace `<path-to-specLang-document>` with the path to your SpecLang document.

## NLP Techniques Used

The SpecValidator CLI uses the following NLP techniques for clarity analysis:

* **Natural language processing (NLP) techniques:** These techniques can be used to flag potentially vague or ambiguous phrases in the specifications.
* **Named entity recognition (NER):** This technique can help identify and categorize key entities within the text, ensuring that important terms are clearly defined and consistently used.
* **Sentiment analysis:** This technique can be used to detect subjective language and ensure that the specifications are written in a neutral and objective tone.
* **Text coherence and cohesion analysis:** These techniques can help ensure that the specifications are logically structured and that the flow of information is clear and easy to follow.

## What is a Specification Validator?

A Specification Validator is a tool designed to analyze and validate specification documents. It ensures that the documents adhere to predefined standards and best practices, providing feedback on their structure, clarity, completeness, and consistency. By doing so, it helps teams create high-quality specifications that are well-structured, unambiguous, and comprehensive, ultimately improving the efficiency and accuracy of the development process.
