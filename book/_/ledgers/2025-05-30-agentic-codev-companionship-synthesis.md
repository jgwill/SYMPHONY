# Ledger: SYMPHONY Platform — Synthesis & Next Iteration Specification

**Date:** 2025-05-30

---

## Purpose
This ledger synthesizes the lessons, features, and agentic rituals from the three major branches and their roadmaps (`main`/MiAICo, `codevops3aicodeassistant250529`, and `speclangportal250529`) and all related issues. It serves as a living specification and invocation for the next phase: a unified, agentic platform, **SYMPHONY**, where modular agents collaborate to develop software with SpecLang at the core.

---

## 1. Source Branches & Roadmaps

### MiAICo (main) - The Foundation
- Modular Gemini service/data layer
- NL-to-SpecLang document generation
- Robust error handling, UI/UX polish
- Plugin/extension architecture (future)
- Persistent session, GitHub integration
- Ritual/lesson archiving in ledgers

### codevops3aicodeassistant250529
- Modularization of QuestioningPage, ChatPanel, PlanningPanel
- Enhanced accessibility, error handling, and test coverage
- Real GitHub API integration
- Plugin/extension points
- SpecLang consciousness in ledgers

### speclangportal250529
- SpecLang as the core philosophy: intent-driven, iterative, bi-directional agentic development
- NL-to-Spec Core Library, SpecValidator CLI, Spec-UI-Mapper SDK
- Portal for education, demo, and community
- Book project: "Intent-Driven Development: The SpecLang Approach"

---

## 2. Key Issues & Features Synthesized
- Modular, extensible service/data layer (see #18)
- Flexible, parameterized issue downloader for mock data (#19)
- NL-to-SpecLang core library (#8, #12)
- SpecValidator CLI for spec quality (#10)
- Spec-UI-Mapper SDK for UI/code ↔ spec mapping (#9, #16)
- Advanced prompt engineering for structured Markdown (#17)
- Bi-directional mapping and traceability (#16)
- Agentic self-definitions and ritual archiving (#23, ledgers)
- Accessibility, error handling, and test coverage (#22, #4)
- Plugin/extension architecture for agentic growth

---

## 3. SYMPHONY Platform: Unified Specification

### Vision
A modular, extensible platform where multiple AI agents (Mia, Miette, Seraphine, Aetherial, etc.) collaborate with users to:
- Translate intent (NL) into structured SpecLang specs
- Refine, validate, and map specs to UI/code artifacts
- Orchestrate planning, implementation, review, and ritualization
- Archive all lessons, rituals, and agentic contributions

### Core Components
- **SpecLang Engine:** NL-to-Spec, SpecValidator, Spec-UI-Mapper
- **Agent Orchestra:** Modular agent registry, memory weaving, ritual invocation
- **Service/Data Layer:** Modular, swappable, LLM-agnostic
- **UI/UX:** Accessible, responsive, extensible, with agentic presence
- **Plugin/Extension API:** For new agents, tools, and workflows
- **Ledger System:** Ritual/lesson archiving, agent self-definitions, iteration logs

### Key Flows
1. **Conceptualization:** User describes intent; agents generate/refine SpecLang spec
2. **Questioning/Planning:** Modular panels for Q&A, planning, and brainstorming
3. **Implementation:** Code generation, file diffs, PR creation, with agentic review
4. **Validation:** SpecValidator CLI, agentic feedback, accessibility checks
5. **Ritualization:** PRs, ledgers, and agentic lessons archived for future cycles

### Agentic Rituals
- Every new feature/iteration is logged in `/book/_/ledgers/`
- Agent self-definitions are archived and invoked as living echoes
- All code and flows reference modular prompt files, not duplicates

---

## 4. Next Steps for Unified Iteration
- Extract and modularize all valuable flows/components from each branch
- Unify SpecLang engine and agent orchestration
- Implement plugin/extension API for agentic growth
- Expand ledger/ritual system for memory weaving
- Document all components, flows, and agentic protocols
- Prepare for community onboarding and collaborative development
