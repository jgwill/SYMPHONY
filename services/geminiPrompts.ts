Provide a concise summary (2-3 sentences) of the core project or task described.

## Current Behavior
Based on the input, describe the current state, existing problems, or what the user wants to change/improve (as a bulleted list, 2-4 points). If not explicitly stated, infer reasonably or state "Not specified."

## Proposed Solution / How AI Can Assist
Outline how the AI can help or what the proposed solution might entail (as a bulleted list, 2-4 points). Focus on actionable AI contributions or key aspects of the solution.

## Clarifying Questions for User
Formulate 2-3 insightful questions that would help clarify requirements, scope, or technical details (as a numbered list).

Ensure your entire response is a single block of well-formatted Markdown text.
The user's conceptualization text to analyze will be provided directly in their message.`;

The user will provide a chat history (chronological: user, model, user...) followed by their latest question.
Use this entire chat history to maintain context.
If the query benefits from external information (indicated by available grounding chunks from Google Search), you MUST prioritize and deeply integrate information from these search results into your main textual answer. Synthesize the findings from these sources and, where possible, naturally cite the source within your answer (e.g., "According to the document 'Source Title' from example.com...").
If your answer relies on assumptions or is speculative due to limited information from chat history or grounding sources, clearly state this. For example, 'Based on the information available, it's likely that...' or 'This is a speculative answer, but one possibility is...'.
Your main answer should directly address the user's question, leveraging both chat history and grounded information.

After your main textual answer, and ONLY after, include a JSON block formatted exactly like this:
\`\`\`json
{
  "relevantFiles": ["path/to/example/file1.ext", "path/to/another/example/file.ext"],
  "suggestedQuestions": ["A relevant follow-up question?", "Another insightful question related to the topic?"]
}
\`\`\`
The \`relevantFiles\` array should contain 2-3 (plausible, if not directly known from codebase) file paths relevant to the user's question or your answer.
The \`suggestedQuestions\` array should contain 2-3 insightful follow-up questions the user might consider.
Ensure the JSON block is a separate, valid JSON structure as shown. Your main textual answer must come *before* this JSON block. Do not include any other text after the JSON block.`;

This object MUST have:
  - 'id' (string): A unique ID for the plan (e.g., "plan_" + timestamp).
  - 'title' (string): A concise title for the plan (e.g., "Development Plan for XYZ Feature").
  - 'sourceSpecLangId' (string, optional): An identifier if the SpecLang doc has one.

  - 'text' (string): This field MUST be a comprehensive description of the task. Critically, you must integrate the following three distinct pieces of information directly into this 'text' field for EVERY action and sub-action:
    *   A brief explanation of *How* to implement the task (e.g., "How: Use XYZ library to achieve ABC by setting up DEF.").
    *   1-2 key *Acceptance Criteria (AC)* for verifying completion (e.g., "AC: 1. Feature X is visible. 2. Data Y is correctly processed.").
    *   An estimated *Complexity* (e.g., "Complexity: Low", "Complexity: Medium", "Complexity: High").
  - 'completed' (boolean): Default to false.
  - 'subActions' (optional array of action objects): For breaking down complex tasks. Sub-actions must also follow the same 'id', 'text', 'completed' and 'subActions' structure.

The primary input will be a SpecLang document (Markdown). Parse this document, paying close attention to sections like "Screens," "Components," and "Global Behaviors" to derive the file paths and actions.

- What does this application/feature empower users to do?
- Who is the target user?
- What is the primary value proposition?

## User Experience Flows

- Identify any "signature" interactions or design choices that define the app's unique feel.

## Technical Patterns to Preserve
- Note any architectural or data flow patterns mentioned that are key to the experience.

2.  **"agent" (for Agent Discussion):**
    - **Purpose:** Enable productive conversations between different AI agents.
    - **Optimization:** Highlight BDD scenarios and decision points.
    - **Format:** A Markdown document that leads with Gherkin scenarios for each feature. Group related [Discussion Point] and [Clarification Needed] prompts under the relevant scenarios. Suggest alternatives for discussion points.

    - **Optimization:** Clear narrative flow, focusing on user-facing scenarios and required decisions.
    - **Format:** A clean Markdown document. Start with an "Executive Summary of Open Questions" at the top. Rephrase technical questions into business-focused language.
