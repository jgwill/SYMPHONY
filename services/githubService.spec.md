# Service Name: githubService

## Purpose
The `githubService` module is responsible for encapsulating all interactions with the GitHub API. Currently, it provides mock implementations for these interactions, contingent on the presence and validity of a `GH_TOKEN` environment variable. The service is designed to be extended in the future to perform real GitHub operations.

## Key Methods & Functions

1.  **`async createPullRequest(repoFullName: string, branchName: string, title: string, body: string, baseBranch: string = 'main'): Promise<{ html_url: string; number: number; message?: string }>`**
    *   **Description:** Simulates the creation of a pull request on GitHub.
    *   **Inputs:**
        *   `repoFullName` (string): The full name of the repository (e.g., "owner/repo").
        *   `branchName` (string): The name of the branch from which the PR is created (head branch).
        *   `title` (string): The title of the pull request.
        *   `body` (string): The description/body of the pull request.
        *   `baseBranch` (string, optional, default: 'main'): The name of the branch into which the changes will be merged (base branch).
    *   **Outputs:** A `Promise` that:
        *   Resolves to an object containing:
            *   `html_url` (string): A mock URL to the created pull request.
            *   `number` (number): A randomly generated mock PR number.
            *   `message` (string, optional): A success message indicating mock operation.
        *   Rejects with an `Error` if `GH_TOKEN` is not configured.
    *   **Behavior:**
        *   Checks if `GH_TOKEN` is valid. If not, rejects.
        *   Logs the mock API call details to the console.
        *   Simulates a delay.
        *   Generates a random PR number and constructs a mock URL.
        *   Returns the mock PR details.

2.  **`async pushToBranch(repoFullName: string, branchName: string, commitMessage: string): Promise<{ commit_url: string; message?: string }>`**
    *   **Description:** Simulates pushing committed changes to a specified branch on GitHub.
    *   **Inputs:**
        *   `repoFullName` (string): The full name of the repository (e.g., "owner/repo").
        *   `branchName` (string): The name of the branch to push to.
        *   `commitMessage` (string): The commit message for the changes being pushed.
    *   **Outputs:** A `Promise` that:
        *   Resolves to an object containing:
            *   `commit_url` (string): A mock URL to the created commit.
            *   `message` (string, optional): A success message indicating mock operation.
        *   Rejects with an `Error` if `GH_TOKEN` is not configured.
    *   **Behavior:**
        *   Checks if `GH_TOKEN` is valid. If not, rejects.
        *   Logs the mock API call details to the console.
        *   Simulates a delay.
        *   Generates a random commit SHA and constructs a mock URL.
        *   Returns the mock commit details.

## Environment Variable Dependency
*   **`GH_TOKEN`:** This service's ability to simulate operations (and in the future, perform real operations) relies on the `process.env.GH_TOKEN` environment variable.
    *   If `GH_TOKEN` is not found, is set to the placeholder `GH_TOKEN_PLACEHOLDER` ("YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN"), or is an empty string, the methods will reject, indicating that the token is not configured.
    *   A warning is logged to the console on module load if the token is missing or is a placeholder.

## Error Handling
*   Currently, the primary error handled is the absence or placeholder value of the `GH_TOKEN`. In such cases, methods reject with an `Error`.
*   Future real implementations would need to handle various GitHub API errors (e.g., authentication failures, non-existent repos/branches, merge conflicts).

## Future Enhancements
*   Replace mock implementations with actual GitHub API calls using a library like `octokit`.
*   Implement proper OAuth flow or PAT handling for secure authentication.
*   Add more GitHub operations as needed by the application (e.g., fetching repository content, creating branches, reading issue data).

## Dependencies
*   `../constants`: For `GH_TOKEN_PLACEHOLDER`.
*   `../lib/utils`: For the `delay` utility function.
