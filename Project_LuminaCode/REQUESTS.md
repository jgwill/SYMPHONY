## Request: Crystallize Enhancements for Visuals Agent (ðŸŽ¨)

**Desired Outcome:**
A "Feature Crystallization" document that defines an enhanced `visuals-agent`. The enhancement should focus on integrating **Structural Thinking** and **Creative Orientation** into its generation process. The agent should be able to generate not just images, but visual representations of structural dynamics (e.g., oscillating vs. advancing patterns) and conceptual relationships described in SpecLang.

**Current Reality:**
The `Visuals Agent` currently generates artistic images, visual diagrams as images, and Mermaid syntax based on direct user prompts. Its functionality is largely reactive to the literal text of the prompt and lacks a deeper understanding of the underlying structural or creative intent.

**Context:**
This will allow the SYMPHONY platform to visualize abstract concepts like "structural tension" or "advancing patterns," making the creative process more tangible for users.

**Update (2025-09-02):**
**Status:** Completed.
**Output:** [feature_crystallization_visuals_agent.md](./feature_crystallization_visuals_agent.md)
