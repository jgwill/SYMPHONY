### Feature: Creative-Oriented Prompt Engineering with Structural Thinking

This upgrade elevates the `prompt-engineer` agent to a new level, focusing on fostering creative outcomes and understanding the underlying structural dynamics of LLM responses through the integration of Creative Orientation and Structural Thinking.

**Key Enhancements:**
*   **Creative Outcome Design:** The agent now explicitly crafts prompts that encourage generative, "advancing patterns" in LLM responses, moving beyond simple problem-solving to eliciting truly creative and progressive outputs.
*   **Structural Pattern Elicitation:** It designs prompts to reveal or produce specific underlying structural patterns in LLM output, ensuring coherence, organization, and desired progression in the generated content.
*   **Analysis for Advancing vs. Oscillating Patterns:** The agent tests and iterates prompts by analyzing whether the LLM's responses exhibit "advancing patterns" (consistent movement toward a desired outcome) or "oscillating patterns" (repetitive or unproductive outputs).

**Benefits:**
*   More effective and innovative LLM outputs that align with creative objectives.
*   Greater control over the structure and progression of LLM-generated content.
*   Reduced instances of repetitive or unhelpful LLM responses.
