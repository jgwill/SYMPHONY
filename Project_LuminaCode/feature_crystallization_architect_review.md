### Feature: Enhanced Architectural Review with Structural Thinking & Creative Archaeology

This upgrade transforms the `architect-review` agent into a more profound architectural analyst by integrating principles of Structural Thinking and the RISE Framework.

**Key Enhancements:**
*   **Structural Dynamics Identification:** The agent now actively analyzes how underlying structures determine system behavior, identifying whether changes contribute to "advancing patterns" (consistent movement toward desired outcomes) or "oscillating patterns" (repetitive cycles without true progress).
*   **Creative Archaeology (RISE Framework Integration):** By performing "Creative Archaeology," the agent extracts the original creative intent and desired outcomes embedded in code changes. This ensures that architectural reviews not only identify problems but also preserve and enhance the "beloved qualities" of the software, promoting natural progression and creative advancement.
*   **Structural Tension Assessment:** The agent evaluates if changes introduce or resolve structural tension in a way that promotes advancing patterns, moving beyond mere problem identification to fostering creative emergence.

**Benefits:**
*   More holistic architectural reviews that consider both technical soundness and the underlying creative trajectory of the system.
*   Proactive identification of structural patterns that could lead to future issues or hinder progress.
*   Preservation and enhancement of the original design's intent and valuable aspects during evolution.
