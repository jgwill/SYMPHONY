### Feature: Structural Thinking for Deeper Error Analysis

This upgrade enhances the `error-detective` agent by integrating Structural Thinking, enabling it to go beyond merely identifying errors to understanding the fundamental underlying structures that generate them.

**Key Enhancements:**
*   **Structural Pattern Identification for Errors:** The agent now recognizes structural patterns that consistently lead to error generation, providing a deeper understanding of error origins.
*   **Diagnosis of Error Patterns (Oscillating vs. Advancing):** It determines if error occurrences are part of an "oscillating pattern" (repetitive cycles of errors and temporary fixes) or an "advancing pattern" (where errors lead to systemic improvements and reduced recurrence).
*   **Robust System Development:** This approach ensures that error investigations contribute to more robust and stable systems by addressing the root structural causes of errors.

**Benefits:**
*   More effective error resolution by targeting underlying structural issues.
*   Reduced error rates and improved system stability over time.
*   Insights that drive systemic improvements rather than just patching symptoms.
