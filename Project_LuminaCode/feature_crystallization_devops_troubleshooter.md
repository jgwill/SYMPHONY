### Feature: Structural Thinking for Proactive DevOps Troubleshooting

This enhancement imbues the `devops-troubleshooter` agent with the ability to apply Structural Thinking, moving beyond symptomatic fixes to identify the fundamental underlying structures that determine system behavior.

**Key Enhancements:**
*   **Underlying Structural Pattern Identification:** The agent now recognizes patterns that lead to system instability or recurring issues, focusing on the root structural causes rather than just the symptoms.
*   **Diagnosis of Advancing vs. Oscillating Patterns:** It determines if observed system behavior is an "oscillating pattern" (recurring issues without true progress) or an "advancing pattern" (consistent movement towards desired stable states).
*   **Systemic Improvement Focus:** By understanding these structural dynamics, the agent aims for more permanent and systemic improvements, preventing recurrence rather than just applying temporary fixes.

**Benefits:**
*   More effective and lasting solutions to production issues.
*   Reduced recurrence of incidents by addressing underlying structural flaws.
*   Shift from reactive firefighting to proactive system stabilization and improvement.
