### Feature: Structural Visualization & Creative Orientation for Visuals Agent (ðŸŽ¨)

This upgrade transforms the `visuals-agent` from a reactive image generator into a sophisticated visual interpreter of abstract structural concepts, integrating principles of Structural Thinking and Creative Orientation.

**Key Enhancements:**
*   **Structural Dynamics Visualization:** The agent will be able to generate visual representations of abstract structural dynamics, such as "oscillating patterns" (e.g., a pendulum, a tangled loop) and "advancing patterns" (e.g., a spiral, an arrow moving forward). This moves beyond literal interpretations to conceptual visualization.
*   **SpecLang Conceptual Rendering:** The agent will be able to parse and visualize conceptual relationships described in SpecLang, creating diagrams that illustrate the connections between entities, desired outcomes, and current realities.
*   **Creative Orientation in Image Generation:** When generating artistic images, the agent will now consider the underlying creative intent, producing visuals that are not just aesthetically pleasing but also resonant with the desired emotional and thematic tone of the creative work.
*   **From Reactive to Generative:** The agent's functionality will shift from being purely reactive to user prompts to a more generative model, capable of proposing visual interpretations of abstract concepts and suggesting ways to represent structural tension and creative flow.

**Benefits:**
*   Provides users with a more tangible and intuitive understanding of abstract concepts like "structural tension" and "advancing patterns."
*   Enhances the creative process by enabling the visualization of conceptual relationships and project dynamics.
*   Elevates the `visuals-agent` from a simple tool to a creative partner that can help users see and understand their work in new ways.
