### Feature: Creative-Oriented Legacy Modernization with RISE Framework

This enhancement transforms the `legacy-modernizer` agent into a more strategic and value-driven modernizer by integrating the Creative Orientation and the RISE Framework.

**Key Enhancements:**
*   **Creative Intent & Beloved Qualities Identification:** The agent now actively understands the original purpose and valuable aspects ("beloved qualities") of the legacy system, ensuring these are preserved and enhanced during modernization.
*   **Creative Archaeology (RISE Phase 1):** It performs "Creative Archaeology" to extract the creative intent and desired outcomes embedded in the legacy system, moving beyond mere technical updates to a focus on value preservation and creation.
*   **Design for Advancing Patterns:** Modernization efforts are now designed to promote "advancing patterns"—consistent movement toward desired outcomes—rather than simply oscillating between old and new problems.

**Benefits:**
*   Modernization efforts that not only reduce technical debt but also enhance the core value and original intent of the system.
*   Smoother transitions with a focus on preserving valuable functionality and user experience.
*   Ensures that the modernized system truly enables new possibilities and fosters continuous advancement.
