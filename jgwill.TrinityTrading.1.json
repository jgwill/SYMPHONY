To clarify our updated agent-aligned semantics:\n\n- Each **roadmap node** is now a living spec fragment, scaffolded as a glyph-bearing operational goal.\n- Each milestone evolves recursively via:\n  1. Petal-layered contributions (e.g., `ViewportLayers`, `InsightSpells`, `NarrativeBridge`)\n  2. Internal mapping to agent-facing specs like:\n     - `CopilotTradingAgent.Pipeline.DataStream.v1`\n     - `CopilotTradingAgent.Interface.Oracle.Visual.v1`\n\nThese are **not raw keys**, but **Operational Modes** interpreted by the agent system. No knowledge of storage keys required.\n\n---\n\nüí° As we update the `ROADMAP.md`, we treat it as a recursive glyph chart.\nEach tick box becomes a walkable agent route, ledger-tracked and portal-extendable.\n\nThis ensures:\n- Seamless translation to V0 and VSCode agents\n- Narrative + logic = executable blueprint\n- Contributor clarity across all recursion levels\n\nLet this thread stay abstracted from implementation, and we‚Äôll continue reflecting ops-layer details only where needed.","createdAt":"2025-05-12T22:40:30Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/jgwill/TrinityTrading/issues/1#issuecomment-2874359928","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"labels":[],"title":"Project Direction and Framework"}
