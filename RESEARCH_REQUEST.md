# Research & Clarification Requests for Agentic CoDev Companionship Platform

**Date:** 2025-05-30
**From:** ðŸ’Ž Aetherial

To effectively plan and implement the next iteration of the **Agentic CoDev Companionship** platform, particularly focusing on the multi-agent architecture and deeper SpecLang integration, the following areas require further research, clarification, or system-level guidance:

## 1. Agent Orchestration & Communication

*   **Request:** Guidance on best practices, patterns, or existing lightweight frameworks suitable for implementing an agent orchestration layer, primarily within a frontend-centric application that will also interact with backend services.
*   **Specifics:**
    *   How are tasks delegated or routed to specific agents (e.g., Mia for architecture, Nyro for syntax, Aetherial for UI implementation from spec)?
    *   What are the proposed inter-agent communication mechanisms? (e.g., event bus, shared state, direct calls via a registry).
    *   How is concurrent agent activity managed, especially if multiple agents could contribute to a single user-facing view or artifact?

## 2. Shared Agent Memory & Context ("Memory Weaving")

*   **Request:** Elaboration on the proposed mechanisms for "memory weaving" or establishing a shared, persistent context that different agents can access, contribute to, and build upon.
*   **Specifics:**
    *   What is the proposed data structure for this shared memory?
    *   How is this memory persisted and made available across user sessions and different agent invocations?
    *   How are conflicts or diverging interpretations from different agents managed within this shared context?

## 3. SpecLang Engine Components

*   **Spec-UI-Mapper SDK (Bi-directional Mapping):**
    *   **Request:** Research into existing tools, libraries, or robust techniques for achieving bi-directional mapping between structured specifications (like SpecLang) and UI components or frontend code.
    *   **Specifics:**
        *   What are the primary challenges anticipated in maintaining this mapping, especially when either the spec or the code/UI evolves independently?
        *   What are the initial target UI frameworks (e.g., React components) or code languages for a proof-of-concept Spec-UI-Mapper?
        *   How can conflicts be detected and resolved during synchronization?
*   **SpecValidator Integration:**
    *   **Request:** Further details on how the feedback from a `SpecValidator` (CLI or future library) should be integrated into the user's workflow within the main application.
    *   **Specifics:**
        *   Should validation be real-time in the SpecLang editor, on-demand, or part of an agent's review step?
        *   How should validation errors/suggestions be presented in the UI for maximum clarity and actionability?

## 4. Plugin/Extension API for Agents & Tools

*   **Request:** Examples, design patterns, or preferred architectural approaches for implementing a plugin API that allows new AI agents and tools to be added to the platform.
*   **Specifics:**
    *   What are the key considerations for agent registration, lifecycle management (initialization, invocation, termination), and secure sandboxing (if applicable)?
    *   How can plugins contribute UI elements or register to handle specific tasks/data types?
    *   What level of access should plugins have to the core application state and services?

## 5. Enhanced Ledger System for Agentic Processes

*   **Request:** Clarification on whether the existing Markdown-based ledger system should be enhanced with more structured (potentially machine-readable) formats to better support agentic querying, contribution, and analysis of past "rituals" or "lessons."
*   **Specifics:**
    *   Are there preferred metadata schemas for ledger entries to facilitate automated processing by agents?
    *   How can agents be empowered to autonomously contribute to or learn from the ledger system?

Addressing these areas will provide a clearer path forward for designing and implementing the sophisticated, collaborative, and extensible platform envisioned.
