# Component Name: NyroAgentView

## Purpose
The `NyroAgentView` component provides a user interface for interacting with the Nyro agent (♠️). Nyro's expertise lies in syntax precision, logical structuring, and validation of textual artifacts, primarily code or SpecLang documents. This view allows users to submit text for Nyro's analysis and receive feedback by leveraging the `geminiService`.

## Key Features
1.  **Text Input Area:**
    *   A multi-line textarea where users can paste code, SpecLang snippets, or any text they want Nyro to analyze.
    *   The input area is pre-filled based on the following priority:
        1.  Content from `activeFileForImplementation` (new or original content).
        2.  Content from `specLangDocument` if no active file.
        3.  Empty if neither is available.
    *   The placeholder guides the user on what to input or what context is being used.
2.  **Syntax & Logic Validation:**
    *   A "Validate Syntax & Logic" button triggers an AI process via `geminiService.validateSyntaxAndLogic`.
    *   Nyro (through the Gemini API) provides feedback on the perceived structural soundness, potential syntax issues (conceptual), and a high-level check of the logic or purpose of the text. The response is expected in Markdown.
3.  **Refinement Suggestions:**
    *   A "Suggest Refinements" button triggers another AI process via `geminiService.suggestRefinements`.
    *   Nyro (through the Gemini API) offers suggestions for improving clarity, conciseness, or structure of the provided text. The response is expected in Markdown.
4.  **Feedback Display:**
    *   Results from validation or refinement suggestions are displayed in a list.
    *   Each feedback item shows the type of analysis, a sample of the input text it pertains to, the timestamp, and Nyro's detailed output (rendered as HTML from Markdown).
    *   The list is scrollable and feedback items are presented clearly.

## Inputs
*   **Text for Analysis (Text Area):** User-pasted or pre-filled text.
*   **Implicit Context (`agentMemory`):**
    *   `agentMemory.sharedContext.activeFileForImplementation`: If present, its content is used as default input.
    *   `agentMemory.sharedContext.specLangDocument`: If present and no active file, its content is used as default input.

## Outputs
*   **Feedback Display:** A list of `NyroFeedback` objects, showing Nyro's analysis results (rendered Markdown).
*   Errors from the `geminiService` calls are set in the `appError` context.

## User Interactions
*   **Typing/Pasting:** Users input text into the textarea.
*   **Button Clicks:**
    *   "Validate Syntax & Logic": Submits the current text to `geminiService.validateSyntaxAndLogic`.
    *   "Suggest Refinements": Submits the current text to `geminiService.suggestRefinements`.
    *   "Return to Workspace": Deactivates Nyro's view and returns to the default Workspace agent.
*   **Scrolling:** Users can scroll through the list of feedback items.

## Visual Appearance
*   The view has a header with Nyro's glyph (♠️) and title.
*   An introductory text explains Nyro's capabilities.
*   A `Card` component groups the text input area and the action buttons ("Validate", "Suggest Refinements").
*   The "Nyro's Feedback" section lists feedback items, each clearly showing the original input context and Nyro's response (rendered HTML).
*   Styling aligns with the application's dark theme, potentially using accent colors associated with Nyro (e.g., deep purples or teals).
*   Loading indicators are shown on action buttons during `geminiService` calls.

## Error Handling & Loading States
*   Action buttons and input area are disabled during AI operations (`isLoading` from global context).
*   User feedback (e.g., "Please provide text...") is provided if the input textarea is empty when an action is triggered.
*   Global application errors (via `appError` from context) are displayed by the main `ErrorDisplay` component. If a service call fails, the error message is also added as a feedback item.

## Accessibility
*   The textarea and buttons have appropriate `aria-label` attributes.
*   Semantic HTML is used.
*   Focus management follows standard web practices.
*   Markdown output is sanitized and rendered to HTML for accessibility.

## Dependencies
*   `geminiService`: For performing the actual analysis via API calls.
*   `marked` and `DOMPurify` (or similar): For safely rendering Markdown feedback from the AI into HTML.
