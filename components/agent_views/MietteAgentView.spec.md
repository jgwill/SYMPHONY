# Component Name: MietteAgentView

## Purpose
The `MietteAgentView` component provides a user interface for interacting with the Miette agent. Miette's role is to bring empathy, user-centric perspectives, and metaphorical understanding to the software development process. This view allows users to leverage Miette's capabilities to enrich development artifacts like user stories, clarify complex concepts, and foster a deeper understanding of user needs.

## Key Features
1.  **User Story Elaboration:**
    *   Allows users to input a standard user story.
    *   Miette (via a mock AI call) processes the story and provides an elaborated version infused with empathetic language, potential user feelings, and a more narrative style.
2.  **Metaphorical Explanation:**
    *   Enables users to input a technical concept, term, or feature description.
    *   Miette generates a simplified explanation using metaphors or analogies to make the concept more accessible and relatable.
3.  **Empathy Map Prompt Generation:**
    *   Users can describe a feature, product, or user persona.
    *   Miette generates a set of guiding questions or prompts designed to help the development team build an empathy map for the described context. This encourages consideration of user thoughts, feelings, pains, and gains.

## Inputs
*   **User Story Input:** A multi-line text area where users can type or paste a user story for elaboration.
*   **Concept Input:** A multi-line text area for users to input technical concepts for metaphorical explanation.
*   **Feature for Empathy Input:** A multi-line text area for users to describe a feature or context for which empathy map prompts are desired.
*   **Implicit Context:** The agent view can implicitly leverage shared context from `agentMemory` (e.g., `specLangDocument`, `currentPlan`), although direct interaction with these is not explicitly built into the UI elements of this version. The agent's *logic* (mocked or real) might use this context.

## Outputs
*   **Interaction Results Display:**
    *   A dedicated area displays the results of Miette's interactions.
    *   Each result shows the original input text (abbreviated), the type of interaction (story, metaphor, empathy_prompts), and Miette's generated output text.
    *   Outputs are presented in a clear, readable format (e.g., using `pre` for whitespace preservation).

## User Interactions
*   Users type into the respective text areas for stories, concepts, or features.
*   Users click dedicated buttons ("Elaborate with Empathy", "Explain with Metaphor", "Get Empathy Prompts") to trigger the (mock) AI generation for the corresponding input.
*   Buttons are disabled during loading states or if the associated input is empty.
*   Generated results are appended to a list in the "Miette's Musings" section.
*   A "Return to Workspace" button allows users to deactivate Miette's view and go back to the default workspace agent.

## Visual Appearance
*   The view has a header with Miette's glyph (ðŸŒ¸) and title.
*   A brief description of Miette's purpose is shown.
*   Interaction sections (story elaboration, metaphor, empathy prompts) are organized, potentially using `Card` components, each with an icon, title, textarea, and action button.
*   The results area is clearly demarcated.
*   Styling aligns with the overall application theme (dark, slate-based colors with accent colors like pink for Miette).

## Error Handling & Loading States
*   Buttons and input fields are disabled when an AI operation is in progress (indicated by `isLoading` from the global context).
*   Loading indicators (e.g., spinners) are shown on action buttons during processing.
*   Global application errors (via `appError` from context) are displayed by the main `ErrorDisplay` component, but Miette's view can also set `appError` if an interaction fails.

## Accessibility
*   Inputs have `aria-label` attributes.
*   Buttons have descriptive `aria-label` attributes.
*   Focus management should follow standard web practices.
*   Content is structured semantically.
