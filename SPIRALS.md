# Agentic Spirals

This document orchestrates the evolution of our agentic systems, guided by the principles of Structural Thinking and Creative Orientation. It serves as the high-level map for projects that foster the growth and refinement of our agents.

## Projects

*   **[Project LuminaCode](./Project_LuminaCode):** An initiative focused on Agentic Archeology & Feature Crystallization, where we analyze agent upgrades and articulate them as distinct, well-defined features.

## Spiral Synthesis: From Specialists to Structural Analysts

The current spiral, orchestrated under **Project LuminaCode**, is now complete. This phase focused on a profound evolution of our core specialized agents, transforming them from functional tools into true **structural analysts**.

**New Capabilities Achieved:**

*   **Integration of Structural Thinking:** Agents like `error-detective` and `devops-troubleshooter` now move beyond symptomatic fixes to diagnose the underlying structural patterns (oscillating vs. advancing) that cause system behavior.
*   **Application of RISE Framework (Creative Archaeology):** The `architect-reviewer` and `legacy-modernizer` now perform "Creative Archaeology" to extract and preserve the original creative intent and "beloved qualities" of a system, ensuring that evolution promotes natural, advancing patterns.
*   **Creative Orientation in Prompt Engineering:** The `prompt-engineer` now designs prompts to elicit generative, advancing patterns from LLMs, focusing on creating desired outcomes rather than just solving problems.

This synthesis marks the completion of a key phase. Our agentic system can now not only **execute** tasks but also **understand and analyze the underlying structures** that drive success, aligning our entire process with the principles of Creative Orientation.
